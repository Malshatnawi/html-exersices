        <p style="font-size: 50px; color: rgb(31, 46, 184);"> <b>Boxing </b>is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.

            Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international gamesâ€”it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds.
            
            A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.
            
            While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient Near East in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.[2] The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[2] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: rgb(31, 46, 184);">1-Boxer/out-fighter</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 50px;color: whitesmoke;">A classic "boxer" or stylist (also known as an "out-fighter") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.[32] Out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: rgb(31, 46, 184);">2-Boxer-puncher</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 50px; color: whitesmoke;">A boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),[36] but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 style="font-size: 60px; color: rgb(31, 46, 184);">3-Counter puncher</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 50px; color: whitesmoke;">Counter punchers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.</p>
